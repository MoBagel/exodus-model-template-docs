# How to update exodusutils

```bash
poetry add exodusutils@latest    # Or to a specific version
```

If this command does not update the version for `exodusutils`, it's probably because the `poetry` cache still contains the `exodusutils` on you current version. Normally this can be solved by waiting for 15 minutes or so.
