# Testing the model

There are several ways to verify that your model algorithm is able to run properly
- Running unit tests
    - Basic tests to ensure basic functionalities work. If any of the unit tests failed, something is wrong with your code.
    - You are encouraged to create new unit tests, since they are much more simple to use then setting up your own script.
- Using the landing page
    - If you just want to test whether your code can work for a piece of data, use your browser and navigate to the main page of the model algorithm.
    - You can run experiments through the landing page, and then inspect the output of the model algorithm service by the `poe watch` command.
- Using the script / writing your own scripts
    - If you don't have access to a browser.
    - Need to setup things in a rather particular way.
