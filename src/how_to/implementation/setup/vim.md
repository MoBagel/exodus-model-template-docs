If you are a hardcore coder, chances are you already know how to use Vim?

## Packages to use

### NeoVim

[NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) provides much better editing experience than vanilla Vim.

### Conquer of Code

[CoC](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) lets you look up definition, autocomplete, and stuff. It uses different language servers under the hood.
