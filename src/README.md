# Introduction

This package is the template for creating a new Exodus IID model algorithm. Your goal as a developer is to implement your own model algorithm using this package.

## What is a model algorithm?

A model algorithm in the Exodus project is a service that can train a machine learning model, persist the trained model, fetch the persisted model from MongoDB, and finally predict using the persisted model.

## How do I read this documentation?

```bash
cd books; python -m http.server
