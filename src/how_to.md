# How to create your own model algorithm

This section will walk you through the process of creating a model algorithm from the ground up. More accurately, it will describe the following processes:
1. Implementing a model algorithm
    1. How to manage dependencies
    2. How to setup the editor
    3. How to train a model
    4. How to persist the model in MongoDB
    5. How to predict using a previously trained model
2. Testing the model algorithm
    1. Using the landing page
    2. Using command line tools
    3. Debugging the model algorithm
    4. Running unit tests to ensure the correctness of some basic operations
3. Publishing your model algorithm
4. Modifying the model algorithm
    1. Migrating the `ModelInfo`
    2. Bumping the version
